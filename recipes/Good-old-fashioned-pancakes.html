    <h3>description</h3><p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3><ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3><ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
