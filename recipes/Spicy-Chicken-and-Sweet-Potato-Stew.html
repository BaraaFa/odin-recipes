        <h3>description:</h3><p>With flavors reminiscent of Morocco and Mexico, this easy yet richly-flavored stew contains loads of chicken, vegetables, and some surprising spices! If desired, pass lime wedges to squeeze over individual servings.</p>
        
        <h3>ingredients:</h3><ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound sweet potato, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>1 orange bell pepper, seeded and cubed</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>steps:</h3><ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in sweet potato, bell pepper, chicken, tomatoes, and 2 cups of water. Season with salt, chili powder, cumin, oregano, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Dissolve flour in 2 tablespoons water, and stir in to boiling stew. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, 10 to 20 minutes. Stir the stew occasionally to keep it from sticking.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes are done, stir in corn and kidney beans. Cook a few minutes until hot, then stir in cilantro before serving.</li>
